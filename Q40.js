 * 
 * 
 * Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds 
 * a Object describing a music album. 
 * The function should take in an artist name and an album title, 
 * and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information. 
 * 
 * Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
 * Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the 
 * album information correctly. 
 * 
 * Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows 
 * you to store the number of tracks on an album. 
 * 
 * If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, 
 * add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. 
 * 
 * Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
